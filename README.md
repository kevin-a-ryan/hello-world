*Github terminology in ALL CAPS

REPOSITORY is a project organizer for folders and data.
BRANCHING is for version control of the files in the project repository
    MASTER BRANCH = default definitive branch (it should always be deployable)
    NEW/FEATURE BRANCH = snapshot of master branch for working on changes (new branch names should be descriptive)
Edits to a feature branch are saved in the feature branch using a COMMIT action
    COMMITS can be named and descriptions of the saved changes can be added
PULL REQUESTS initiate the process of merging a FEATURE BRANCH with the MASTER BRANCH
	Differences between the code can be viewed using the COMPARE CHANGES feature
	Each PULL REQUEST can be named and descriptions can be added
	Submitting a PULL REQUEST does not automatically merge the FEATURE BRANCH with the MASTER BRANCH
	Submitting a PULL REQUEST initiates a CONVERSATION about the changes that team members can review and comment on
	Team members can review meta data regarding the PULL REQUEST
A MERGE occurs when a team member accepts the changes in the PULL REQUEST and chooses to MERGE to the MASTER BRANCH
	A MERGE must be CONFIRMED
	The FEATURE BRANCH can be deleted after the merge
	Team members can still comment on the PULL REQUEST CONVERSATION after it has been MERGED to MASTER BRANCH
